# 🚀 Scalable Internship Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a scalable cloud-based database system for managing intern applications and records for Internee.pk.

The system migrates an existing MySQL database to a managed cloud database service (AWS RDS / GCP Cloud SQL / Azure SQL Database) and enables read replicas to improve performance, availability, and scalability.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and deploy a highly available, scalable, and production-ready database architecture capable of:

- Managing intern applications efficiently
- Supporting high traffic loads
- Improving read performance using replicas
- Ensuring data reliability and backup
- Providing secure cloud-based access

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Core Components:

- Cloud Managed Database (RDS / Cloud SQL / Azure SQL)
- MySQL Database Engine
- Read Replica(s)
- IAM / Role-based Access Control
- Automated Backups
- Monitoring & Performance Insights

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- MySQL
- AWS RDS / GCP Cloud SQL / Azure SQL Database
- MySQL Workbench / CLI
- Cloud Console
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Database Migration

Created managed MySQL instance in the cloud.
